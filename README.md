CS302ST: Databases

## Overview
As part of our final project for our database course, we were tasked with designing and implementing any database-related application using MySQL. We were free to choose any topic, so we selected something useful and fun: creating a database about wineries in the Walla Walla Valley, Washington.

Walla Walla is renowned for its wine, offering a variety of vineyards and tasting rooms across several regions in the city. Whether you're a tourist planning a visit, a wine enthusiast searching for specific wines, or even a local interested in discovering more about the offerings, this project is designed to make the information easy to query all in one single place.

Our goal was to demonstrate relational database design principles and SQL querying, while creating something that could be genuinely useful to a wide range of users. 

## Features
- Regional classification: Airport District, Downtown Walla Walla, Oregon Valley;
- Winery details: name, email, phone, address;
- Specific wine details: name, vintage, price, type, alcohol percentage, and category;
- Specific operating hours;
- A SQL database designed for querying; and
- Example queries to explore winery information

## Technical Components
- Data collected manually and structured in Excel
- MySQL used for database creation and querying
- Table relationships modeled through E-R and schema diagram/s
- SQL features used:
  - Joins
  - SET and VARCHAR data types
  - Primary keys
  - More! 

## Future Improvements
- Add detailed wine information (e.g., appellation, harvest time, tasting notes)
- Support for inventory tracking (e.g., sold-out wines)
- Add wine ratings and user accounts for personalized features
